# Student-Event-Hub

## Overview
Student Event Hub is a web-based platform designed to simplify event management and attendance for students.

The platform emphasizes safety and accountability through user profiles, ratings, and event requisites.

## Key Features

* Hosts must provide a formal authorization declaration for event locations to avoid legal issues.
* Events are displayed on a map without revealing precise locations.
* Hosts can monitor guest sign-ups, check requisites, and manually approve attendees before revealing the event's precise address.
### Attendee Functionality
* Attendees create profiles and can view a map of nearby events.
